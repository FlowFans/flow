Follow the steps below to start your own version of Kitty Items.

## Check prerequisites

Before moving to the next step, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### NodeJS

Ensure you have NodeJS [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/). Version **16+** is required.

```
> node -v

v16.x.x
```

> **ðŸ“£ Tip**: Need to manage different versions of NodeJS? Try using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Flow CLI

Ensure you installed the [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/). Version **0.32.3+** is required.

```
> flow version

Version: v0.32.3
```

## Clone the project

To get started, clone the project to your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items.git
```

A new folder, `kitty-items`, will be created. You will work in this folder, so navigate into it:

```sh
cd kitty-items
```

## Install dependencies

In the project directory, run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

> **Note**: This process may take a few seconds and you will see some logs. This is expected.

Once the installation is completed, you are ready to start the project.

### Apple M1 compatibility

In case you are on an [Apple M1 machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1), you have to install another package run the NextJS web application on your system. If you don't know if you are running on Apple M1, skip this step.

```sh
# move to the web folder
cd web/

# install package
npm i @next/swc-darwin-arm64

# move back to the project root
cd ..
```

> **Note**: This installation will fail if you are not on an Apple M1 machine
