Now that you made you changes work on the emulator, you can deploy them to the testnet. This will upgrade the contracts you intially uploaded.

## Start on testnet

Run the project on the testnet again with you existing account:

```sh
npm run dev:testnet
```

## Open Kitty Items

Kitty Items should be running on the testnet. Visit [`http://localhost:3001`](http://localhost:3001) to try it out.

## Mint a new star on testnet

Go to Kitty Items admin dashboard. Mint a new item a few times, until the star shows up!
